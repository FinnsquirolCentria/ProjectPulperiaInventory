# Phase 4 ‚Äì Project Presentation

## üéØ Project Title
Pulper√≠a Inventory Management System

## üìù Project Overview
The Pulper√≠a Inventory Management System is designed to help small neighborhood store owners in Nicaragua manage their inventory, sales, and restocking processes. The system is tailored for low-tech users with limited budgets, providing an intuitive interface and localized features such as prices in c√≥rdobas and common product lists. 

Target users include pulper√≠a owners and their employees, as well as customers looking for nearby stores.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js and styled using CSS. Used `react-leaflet` for map integration.
- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express.js. Sequelize ORM was used to interact with a MySQL database.
- **Database**: MySQL database stores product, sales, and user data.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Sales Tracking**: Manual sales input with automatic stock updates.
  - **Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory dashboard with low-stock alerts.
  - **Map Integration**: Displays nearby pulper√≠as using GPS and OpenStreetMap.
  - **Reports**: Generates sales reports with export options (CSV).

## üöÇ Development Process
1. **Phase 1**: Defined use cases and user flows.
2. **Phase 2**: Built the basic structure, including login and inventory management.
3. **Phase 3**: Added advanced features to sales reports, polished previous features and added a new functionality.
4. **Phase 4**: Finalized the project, added map integration, and prepared the presentation.

Key decisions:
- Focused on simplicity for low-tech users.
- Prioritized features like inventory tracking and sales reports over advanced analytics.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work
### What Worked Well
- The map integration with `react-leaflet` provided a user-friendly way to locate nearby pulper√≠as.
- The low-stock alert system was effective and easy to implement.

### Challenges
- Implementing users.
- Optimizing the backend API for faster responses.

### Future Improvements
- Add a barcode scanner for faster sales input.
- Implement a mobile app version for better accessibility.
- Enhance the reporting system with more visualization options.
